Breakfast is laid out a little differently today, keeping us on our toes. Quick
munch, then back in the motor for the ride to the airport. Lovely hazy blue sky
and empty roads for the trip to the airport. I always feel guilty handing back a
rental car, like I’ve broken something and am trying to conceal it. I didn’t
break anything, there was nothing left to break.

“Do you need to check it?”

“I thought you said it was fine”

“Yeah it’s fine”

“Well that’s fine then, have a safe journey”

What a lovely adventure. Finished my book on the flight home. Honeymoon not
strictly over yet: tomorrow we have an evening in the beehive.
