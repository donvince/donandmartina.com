Much more chilled out day today following the busy one yesterday. Martina had
spotted a few shops she’d like to investigate along old town so we went for a
wander along there. Once the course was clear, I doubled ahead and read outside
at a cafe. Martina wasn’t shopping for long. We went to the riverside. On the
way to find one of Martina’s recommended cafes, we spy a lady in a sailor's
outfit selling boat rides and sign up. When it was time for the boat ride, there
had been a tiny little shower, which I guess scared off any other potential
passengers, so we had the boat to ourselves (well, just us and the guy driving
the thing).

I grabbed a beer from the fridge and we sat at the front, almost titanic style,
though sitting down, and not sinking.

The boat first headed south straight out of the city centre. Very quickly the
hubbub of the city was left behind and our surroundings were more like the
middle of the countryside. Ducks, trees, grass. The river split, the other side
had a bridge over it. Very chilled out, relaxing and lovely.

At some reasonably arbitrary seeming point, we made a u-turn and headed back
towards the city, equally lovely in reverse. This time we went past the start
point and into the centre. Passing under all the bridges we’d been introduced to
the previous day on the first tour. Seeing nooks and crannies from this new
angle is pretty cool. We go all the way along past the covered market and dragon
bridge before turning back and mooring up.

The cafe turned out to be a place we’d visited before, this time same or similar
to how we found it last time. Funky lights with zigzagging elements, pushbikes
and bold orange coloured tubing, drinks in test tubes. We ordered drinks and sat
outside playing cards. Martina’s getting a bit too good at rummy now! Blue
cocktail drinks. Watching the world go by. Another bar with a 2 piece band near
congress square. Sneaky night-time creeping up on us a bit quick. Flying home in
the morning tomorrow.
